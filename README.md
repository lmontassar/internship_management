# Internship Request Management System - La Poste Tunisienne

This project is a web application for managing internship requests, developed as part of an internship at the Training Department of La Poste Tunisienne. The goal of this application is to digitize and streamline the process of submitting and managing internship applications, which was previously handled manually.

The application provides a user-friendly platform for students to submit their internship requests online and for administrators to efficiently manage the assignment of students to available supervisors. It also centralizes the management of supervisors, student profiles, and the coordination between supervisors and accepted interns.
